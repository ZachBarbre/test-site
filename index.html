        <img src="images/cthulhu.jpg" alt="Illistrations of the Old Ones by Jonathan Elliott">
        <p>These are the Great Old Ones. They are original artwork by Jonathan Elliott. Please click the image to view the next piece. While each stands on its own they are truly meant to be viewed a part of the whole. As you click to the next Old One you man feel something dark, deep in your soul. Do not be alarmed. This is normal. Concentrate on the darkness and click once more. Feel the cold emanating out from this point. Click once more and embrace the voidâ€¦ </p>
        <p>In summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the images to vew all the Old Ones</li>
            <li>Enjoy as you slowly go mad.</li>
        </ul>
